| [Predict prices of airline tickets]([https://www.kaggle.com/code/yeehawww/titanic-spaceship-competition/notebook](https://github.com/tengkumuazabs/my-portfolio/blob/main/python-projects/Predict_prices_of_airline_tickets.ipynb)) | *some findings goes here. |

# Kaggle Competitions

| Link | Tools | Description | 
|---|---|---|
| [Titanic Spaceship Data Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/code/yeehawww/titanic-spaceship-competition/notebook) | Python | This competition gives me 80.0% of score that puts me at 663 out of 2668 participants (Top 25%). The algorithm VotingClassifier between CatBoost and GaussianNB was used. |
| [Digit Recognizer Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/yeehawww/digit-recognizer-using-neural-network) | Python | 96.4% of score was achieved using simple Neural Network algorithm. Currently I am at 1276 out of 1586 participants (Top 81%). |
| [Titanic Spaceship Data Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/yeehawww/digit-recognizer-using-neural-network) | Python | Again, by using VotingClassifier between CatBoost and GaussianNB, I got 78.2% of score and I am currently in 2503 out of 15892 participants (Top 16%). |
