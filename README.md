# Thesis at Master's Degree (Image Enhancement and Hybrid CNN to Improve COVID-19 Classification Performance on Chest X-Ray Images)
The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed many lives and is predicted to continue. The classification process using CXR images has been widely carried out and uses various methods, one of which is using a hybrid CNN model. To improve classification performance using a hybrid CNN model, image enhancement techniques can be applied to CXR images. This research proposes the CLAHE image enhancement technique which is applied to CXR images which are then classified using a hybrid CNN model. The experimental results show that there is an increase in classification performance as evidenced by the highest AUC value of 0.821. Testing results also show a significant increase in classification performance between the proposed hybrid CNN model and the existing hybrid CNN models.

# Python Projects
| Link | Description |
|---|---|
| [Predict prices of airline tickets](https://github.com/tengkumuazabs/my-portfolio/blob/main/python-projects/Predict_prices_of_airline_tickets.ipynb) | Doing a complete data science framework from cleaning the data, engieering the features, to price prediction for airline tickets using Random Forest Regressor and then hypertune the model. | 
| [Predict status of chronic kidney disease](https://github.com/tengkumuazabs/my-portfolio/blob/main/python-projects/Predict_status_of_chronic_kidney_disease.ipynb) | Address the chronic kindney disease classification problem by applying XGBoost and then Randomized Search which resulted in best parameter for the classifier. | 
| [Predict the cancellation of hotel bookings](https://github.com/tengkumuazabs/my-portfolio/blob/main/python-projects/Predict_the_cancellation_of_hotel_bookings.ipynb) | Using multiple classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Decision Tree to predict the cancellations in binary format. | 

# Kaggle Competitions

| Link | Tools | Description | 
|---|---|---|
| [Titanic Spaceship Data Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/code/yeehawww/titanic-spaceship-competition/notebook) | Python | This competition gives me 80.0% of accuracy The algorithm VotingClassifier between CatBoost and GaussianNB was used. |
| [Digit Recognizer Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/yeehawww/digit-recognizer-using-neural-network) | Python | 96.4% of score was achieved using simple Neural Network algorithm. |
| [Titanic Spaceship Data Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/yeehawww/digit-recognizer-using-neural-network) | Python | Again, by using VotingClassifier between CatBoost and GaussianNB, I got 78.2% of accuracy. |

# SQL
| Link | Description |
|---|---|
| [Airport Database Analysis](https://github.com/tengkumuazabs/my-portfolio/blob/main/sql/Airport_database_analysis.md) | Applying some SQL queries to answer couple of questions regarding aviation use case. Multiple tables are involved here with their uniqe relation each other. Here, couple entities has been analysed such as airplane info, passengers info, and airport info. |
| [Supermart Database Analysis](https://github.com/tengkumuazabs/my-portfolio/blob/main/sql/Supermart_database_analysis.md) | Doing analysis by answering couple of questions in market business like who did the order the most, what is the top 5 most ordered product, who ordered product X, etc. |
