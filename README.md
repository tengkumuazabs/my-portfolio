# Thesis at Master's Degree (Image Enhancement and Hybrid CNN to Improve COVID-19 Classification Performance on Chest X-Ray Images)
The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed many lives and is predicted to continue. The classification process using CXR images has been widely carried out and uses various methods, one of which is using a hybrid CNN model. To improve classification performance using a hybrid CNN model, image enhancement techniques can be applied to CXR images. This research proposes the CLAHE image enhancement technique which is applied to CXR images which are then classified using a hybrid CNN model. The experimental results show that there is an increase in classification performance as evidenced by the highest AUC value of 0.821. Testing results also show a significant increase in classification performance between the proposed hybrid CNN model and the existing hybrid CNN models.

# Kaggle Competitions

| Link | Tools | Description | 
|---|---|---|
| [Titanic Spaceship Data Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/code/yeehawww/titanic-spaceship-competition/notebook) | Python | This competition gives me 80.0% of score that puts me at 663 out of 2668 participants (Top 25%). The algorithm VotingClassifier between CatBoost and GaussianNB was used. |
| [Digit Recognizer Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/yeehawww/digit-recognizer-using-neural-network) | Python | 96.4% of score was achieved using simple Neural Network algorithm. Currently I am at 1276 out of 1586 participants (Top 81%). |
| [Titanic Spaceship Data Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/yeehawww/digit-recognizer-using-neural-network) | Python | Again, by using VotingClassifier between CatBoost and GaussianNB, I got 78.2% of score and I am currently in 2503 out of 15892 participants (Top 16%). |
